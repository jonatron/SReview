=head1 NAME

sreview-transcode - transcode the output of L<sreview-cut> into production-quality media files

=head1 SYNOPSIS

sreview-transcode TALKID

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<sreview-transcode> performs the following actions:

=over

=item *

Look up the talk with id TALKID in the database.

=item *

Create the preroll slide from the preroll template, after applying template
changes to it

=item *

If a postroll template is defined, create the postroll slide using the same
process as for the preroll slide. If no postroll template is defined, use the
statically configured preroll

=item *

If an apology template is defined and the current talk has an apology
note that is not zero length and not NULL, create the apology slide for
this talk

=item *

Convert the preroll slide, postroll slide, and (if any) apology slide to
a 5-second video with the same properties as the main raw video

=item *

For each of the configured profiles, do a two-pass transcode of the
concatenated version of preroll, apology (if available), main, and
postroll videos to a production video

videos without re-transcoding anything. If not specified, uses the input
video as a "profile".

=head1 SVG TRANSFORMATIONS

The transformation performed over the SVG files is a simple C<sed>-like
replacement of input tags in the template file. All data is XML-escaped
first, however.

The following tags can be set inside the SVG file:

=over

=item @SPEAKERS@

The names of the speakers, in this format:

=over

Firstname Lastname, Firstname Lastname and Firstname Lastname

=back

=item @ROOM@

The name of the room where the talk was held.

=item @TITLE@

The title of the talk.

=item @SUBTITLE@

The subtitle of the talk.

=item @DATE@

The date on which the talk was held.

=item @APOLOGY@

The apology note defined for this talk.

=back

If one of these fields has no data for the given talk, then the tag will
be replaced by the empty string instead.

In addition, as of version 0.7, the template is processed by
L<Mojo::Template> with the L<SReview::Talk> object for the current talk
assigned to the C<$talk> variable, which allows for far more
flexibility. See the documentation of L<Mojo::Template> for more details
on that templating engine, and the documentation of L<SReview::Talk> for
the available values from that object.
