    title: Test talk with all optional fields
# The "id" field should not change, *evah*. If no id field is given, the
# slug is used. If no slug is given, it is autogenerated from the title.
#
# This means that, if the title is ever changed, the talk will be seen
# as new (and the old one will be marked as ignored) unless either the
# slug or the id is set to the slug/id that was generated from the
# title.

    description: A test talk with all optional fields filled out. Note that we did leave out the "length_minutes" field, as that one is implied by the endtime one.
